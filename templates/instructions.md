# Playlist Pattern Scraper

This app allows you to give me permission to download some information from your Spotify account.  In particular, it allows me to download your artist and track affinity over the last ~1 month, ~6 months, and all time.

In case you are interested, the app accomplishes this by programmatically requesting this information with proof of your authorization from a service provided by spotify for this type of thing: https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/personalization/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks/

## What's in it for you?

1. In a few weeks, I will send you a personalized playlist of music recommendations based on the music of other users who have similar taste in music.
2. The satisfaction of knowing you have allowed me to learn and discover tons of great music.


## How it works

1. Click the "Begin" button. (Then DON'T hit the back button.  This app is slow.  Be patient).
2. Authenticate through Spotify and maybe Facebook.
3. You're done!  I'll send you some results in a few weeks.
