# Playlist Pattern Scraper

This app allows you to give me permission to download some information from your Spotify account.  In particular, it allows me to scrape the track data from playlists matching any of the following patterns:

    My Shazam Tracks
    Your Top Songs <year>
    The Ones That Got Away
    Your Summer Rewind
    Discover Weekly

## What's in it for you?

1. In a few weeks, I will send you a personalized playlist of music recommendations based on the music of other users who have similar taste in music.
2. The satisfaction of knowing you have allowed me to learn and discover tons of great music.


## How it works

1. Click the "Begin" button.
2. Authenticate through Spotify and maybe Facebook.
3. You're done!  I'll send you some results in a few weeks.
